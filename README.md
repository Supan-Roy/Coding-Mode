# Coding Mode – Chrome Extension

Coding Mode helps you focus on problem-solving and learning by temporarily blocking AI chat sites (like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, etc.) during coding sessions. Unlock early with TOTP authentication, customize blocked domains, and optionally auto-trigger sessions on coding platforms.

## Features
- Temporarily block AI chat sites during coding sessions
- TOTP unlock for early session end (optional)
- Custom domain blocking
- Auto-trigger on coding platforms (user-controlled)
- Modern, theme-adaptive UI
- Privacy-first: No data leaves your device

## How it Works
- Start a session from the extension popup to block AI chatbots for a set time
- Optionally require a TOTP code to end a session early
- Add or remove blocked domains in the settings
- Enable/disable auto-trigger for coding platforms

## Privacy
- All data is stored locally in your browser
- No data is ever sent to any server
- All permissions are user-controlled

See [extension/PRIVACY.md](extension/PRIVACY.md) for full details.
